            <h3>Why recipes?</h3>
                <p class="why">During my yr12 work experience, got given an online coding course (The Odin Project) to complete. One of the tasks was to use skills to make a recipe website and use other skills we learn to keep improving. I have put in my own collection of recipes that I love and use. This task on the course was great in getting me back into coding and rekindle my enjoyment from it (despite it often becoming frustrating and challenging but it is all worth it in the end). It has been a fairly basic project trying to bring my new skills together and still has some slight bugs and errors which I hope to fix and make it fully functioning and great to use.</p>
